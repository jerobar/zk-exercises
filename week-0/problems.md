# ZK Prelim Problem Set

### 1

A trivial group can be formed with the set by defining the binary operator * as: a * b = a. 

The group is closed as the result of every operation is in the set. 

The operation a * b = a is associative as it always produces the same result regardless of the order of operations. 

Each element is the “identity element”.

Each element is its own inverse. 

### 2

Division is closed but not associative for real numbers.

### 3

Division is not closed for real numbers as 0 is a real number and division by 0 is undefined. 

### 4

Multiplication of two odd integers always results in another odd integer. The set of all odd integers forms a group. 

Addition of two even integers always results in an even integer, however, all even integers do not form a group due to the absence of identity and inverses. Instead, this set forms a semigroup. 

### 5

The identity matrix is the 3x2 zero matrix. The inverse matrix B of A is any other matrix that satisfies A + B = Identity (zero) matrix. 

The group cannot be cyclic as there is no single matrix that can be added to itself to generate all other matrices (for example, to generate the identity element). 

### 6

Closed - The modulus operator ensures that the result always remains within the set of integers.

Associative - Addition of integers is associative.

Identity - 0 is the identity element and is within the set.

Inverses - For all a in the set, its inverse is -a mod p. Adding a mod p to -a mod p = 0. 

### 7

Closed - For any two elements g^a and g^b where a, b are integers, g^a * g^b is also an element in the set. 

Associative - Multiplication is inherently associative. 

Identity - The identity element 1 is within the set.

Inverses - For every g^n, there exists a modular multiplicative inverse g^-n such that g^n * g^-n mod p = 1.

### 8

A straightforward homomorphism exists between integers and constant polynomials (polynomials of degree 0) e.g. 5 -> p(x) = 5.

This homomorphism, however, would not work for polynomials of degree > 0 as there is no way to consistently map them to integers.
